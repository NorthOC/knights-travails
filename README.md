# Knight Travails!

Hi! Using breadth-first search (as opposed to depth-first), this program takes the knight chess piece, and shows the minimum moves a knight needs to make to end up on a specified square. 

## Example 

On a 8x8 board, from 1, 1 to 4, 4 it would take 2 moves: 
[1, 1] -> [2, 3] -> [4, 4]

## Setup
The default value of the board size is set to 8, so feel free to change Board.new(number here) in main.rb. In the other line, the first argument is the starting position and the second argument is the last position.

To run, you have to have Ruby installed, cd into the repo, and run the command in your CLI:
`ruby main.rb`
